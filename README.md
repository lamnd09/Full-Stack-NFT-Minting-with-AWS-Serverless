# NFT Project on AWS Serverless
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for managing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain deployed in AWS Services.
**[General Requirement]** Develop a serverless web application with a basic dashboard for a minting and distribution system of rewards in an NFT project. Implement a cron job to retrieve data from a database and automate the minting, distribution, and coin rewards for each NFT in a secure and scalable way using AWS technologies

## Architecture Design

Based on the requirements, I design an AWS Serverless system as below:

## 1. Application Features
- Mint new NFTs with unique metadata and tokenURI
- View owned NFTs and their details
- Explore the NFT marketplace
- Trade NFTs with other users

## 2. Technologies Used
### 2.1. For local testing Boilerplate 
- Solidity: Programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum
- Truffle: Development framework for Ethereum DApps
- Open Zeppelin: Library for secure smart contract development
- Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- IPFS: Decentralized storage for NFT metadata
- Ganache: Local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing
  
 ### 2.2 For AWS deployment 
 - AWS Account 
 - AWS serverless, Lambda, CloudFront, DynamoDB, etc. 
 - Amazon API Gateway
 - AWS Amazon Managed Blockchain
 - [Optional] Amazon Cognito
 - Useful link: ... add a youtube link here 

## 3. Project Setup
The detail of instructions is described as below
1. [Create AWS AMB to communicate with Ethereum Goerli testnet](./docs/documentation/1_Create_AMB_node.md)
2. [Create and Deploy Smart Contract to Local/Testnet Blockchain](./docs/documentation/2_Create_local_testing_ganache.md)
2. [Create AWS Lambda function to interact with Ethereum blockchain](./docs/documentation/2_Create_Lambda_function.md)
